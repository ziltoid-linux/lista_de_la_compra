Or download the latest APK from the [Releases Section](https://github.com/jaimegonzalezfabregas/lista_de_la_compra/releases/latest).


This is a shopping list app, with integrated meals scheduler. It features local sync, that is, synchronization between instances without the need of a central server. A headless server is also provided.


This branch contains the simplified grocery-list build.

## 🏗️ Architecture
Some offline games (like Minecraft) can be used either offline, as a client of other instances, or serve its game to other clients.

*Lista de la compra* can act as server and client simultaneusly, in a _peer to peer_ achitecture.

- When acting as a server, the UI shows all the reachable IP addresses, and also anounces itself using zeroconf/mdns.
- When acting as a client, the UI shows the detected servers, and allows to enter a custom server.

### 🛠️ Use Cases
- Padawan Level: Use a single app instance to track your groceries 
- Jedi Knight Level: Share your databases between your family and synchronize your instances with your home Wi-Fi 
- Jedi Master Level: When shopping, turn on the access point (Wi-Fi tethering) on one of your smartphones, and connect the remaining instances to that Wi-Fi 
- Sith Level: Install a VPN server on your home or VPS, connect all your smartphones to that VPN 
- Sith lord level: Add the [standalone server](./packages/lista_de_la_compra_server/README.md) to your VPN

## 🔒 Encryption
In terms of encryption we have no encryption. Please connect only to fully trusted networks while synchronizing the app databases.

## 🖥️ Standalone Server
You can host a server in your own LAN. See the instructions in [lista_de_la_compra_server](./packages/lista_de_la_compra_server/README.md).
